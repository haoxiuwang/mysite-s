***No personnel expenses, no office expenses, Aomoxo, a company composed of tens of thousands of talents, will grow rapidly at near zero cost.***

### Rule Number One: Zero Personnel Expense

Unlike ordinary employees, Every dollar the talents get from the company must come from the company's profit, which is their only source of income. We will never borrow money or use the investors' money to pay our stock-holding members. Zero Personnel Expense means that no money is made, nobody gets paid, the company's profit is zero, then the labor cost is also zero.

**All the good things must be created by our own hands!**

As one of Aomoxo's stock-holding talents, from the day you joined us, you have come for the extraordinary dream of becoming a billionaire@#. You will always know very clearly that for every market value, how much your worth will be, how high the market value needs to be for your net worth to become tens of millions, or for your billionaire@# dream to become a reality. And you should also know that as Aomoxo's stock-holding talent, you have the right to share the market value, and when the company achieves profitability, also receive salary and bonuses like ordinary employees, and not only that, you, along with all of your fellow members, have the right to share 90% of the company's profit.

However, there is no free lunch in the world. Market value, profit, net worth, wealth and so on, all these wonderful things we all so expect, can only truly belong to us through hard works. No money is made, no one gets paid, this rule of Aomoxo Plan's Zero Personnel Expense , is to tell the talents clearly that joining Aomoxo, you must not have even a tiny bit of opportunism. All income the talents get from Aomoxo must be completely created by all talents.

Moreover, we firmly believe that all miracles are made by talents. So as long as those who have come for the dream of billionaire@#, are talented, down-to-earth and hard working people, it should easy thing to achieve satisfying salaries for all of us. To make our first move, We will prioritize in choosing projects with mature profit models, that are also easy to profit. Once we started making money, we will immediately use the money to pay wages and dividends, so that the talents can enjoy the initial fruits of success, and go on pursuing the extraordinary dreams of becoming a billionaire@# with more confidence than ever.

### Rule Number Two: Zero Office Expense


No brisks, no tiles, no tables, no chairs, Aomoxo's office buildings are built completely on the web, and and no less efficient. With our members working entirely through the internet, and all Aomoxo's office expenses will disappear from our income statement.

Establishing the company completely on the Internet will not only help realize the idea of ​​globalization and allow talents to enjoy the incredible freedoms that comes with it, but also make a 10,000-and-more-member company burdenless, and easily remove the cost of hundreds of millions of dollars: no need for building or renting office spaces; no need to purchase various office equipment and supplies; nor the necessary routine maintenance; There are absolutely no expense that comes with a centralized office. Every one of Aomoxo's talents will work in their own living environment, reuse their personal computers and home networks, and thus eliminate any potentially huge office expense.

We're not going to do business in an extravagant style, waste absolute nothing! And we don't care about other people might think of us, Aomoxo is going to become a real "zero expense company", saving all unnecessary expenses and put precious resources on the most important things.

#### Zero-expense entrepreneurial model, paving the way for the final implementation of the Aomoxo Plan.

**Aomoxo can quickly form a team of more than 10,000 people without needing the help from capital.**

Under normal circumstances, it is a very high threshold to form an elite team with more than 10,000 people. Don't even think about it if you don't have strong financial resources. First you need to be able to pay the salary of each team member. With an average annual salary of 300,000 yuan@# per capita, you would need tens of billions of yuan to pay 37,200 team members every year. And even if you managed to hire so many peope, it would be hard to keep them. It is also important that if you want to get this huge team really work, only salary is not going to be enough, you also need enough financial resources to build an office space that can accommodate tens of thousands of people, whether it is for a one-time construction cost, or annual maintenance fees, various office fees, etc. The cost of this scale can range from ten million to hundreds of millions.

However, when we start to be brave and make changes, all these seemingly immovable obstacles have all vanished in an instant. Not to mention 37,200 people, even double that number of people, Aomoxo can accommodate them as they come.

#### Aomoxo will not encounter the threat of capital chain breakage in its entrepreneurial process, it will be able to withstand any rain and hail with vigor.

There won't be a situation in which Aomoxo cannot pay its employees, or pay the due rent or utility bills; nor situation in which anxious employees are resigning one by one due to the company’s financial constraints and arrears; nor situation in which the capital chain breaks and the normal running of the company's been forced to a stop, leading to crisis like disruptions of projects and business stagnations. Aomoxo's Zero Expense Model has completely eliminated the root of those problems above. Our entrepreneurial process is absolutely capable of withstanding any kind of storms that would come our way.

#### Efficient Financing Plan, using as few shares as possible to solve our financing problems.

First of all, let's take a look at the maximum number of shares that Aomoxo can use for financing. Since the shares held by the ten founders of Aomoxo are also included in the 90% talent incentive shares, the remaining 10% of shares can be used exclusively for financing to meet our future needs. In addition, to make sure the company's survival emergencies, we've also set up the 25% percent of shares that's for recruiting the 25,000 1/100 Billionare Class Members, also as a financing emergency reserve stock, which is used only when it's about the company's survival. Only at critical moments, some or all of it can be used for financing. So with this arrangement, the shares that Aomoxo can use for financing are up to 35% of the total shares, ensuring the safety of financing.

Here, we need to state that the 25% of the spare shares could be regarded as a precautious. Aomoxo’s development relies deeply on talents. So it's vaitally important for us to use 90% of the shares to inspire tens of thousands of elites to build a new trillion-dollar market value company. Using the 25% shares on financing only when it is absolutely necessary, and as little as possible.

In fact, through a series of innovations such as Zero Expense Business Model and Efficient Financing Plan, Aomoxo Plan has eliminated the "soil" that causes capital chain rupture on the mechanism level, and 10% of the shares are more than enough for financing. Therefore, it can be optimistically expected that in the future 25% of shares will be able to be used for talent incentive in accordance with the original arrangements of the Talent Shareholding Plan, and 25,000 talents@# will be added to the team.

### Rule Number Three: We won't burn cashes, won't be financing speculators, or raising money for money's sake, and never use investors’ money on eating, drinking, and whatnot.

Aomoxo's trillion-dollar market value goal cannot be achieved by poor ideas. There are always many choices and paths in front of us. We will not choose projects that needs to burn lots of money to carry out, and we will not make raising capital as our top priority. Even when we do need to spend money, we will continue to carry forward the innovative spirit of the Aomoxo Plan, and try solving our financial related problems in a creative way, so that projects that would otherwise require a lot of money can be started with no worries, and would go smoothly under Aomoxo's Zero Expense Model.

Every dollar we save can make our business less dependent on capital, and can save more shares to further enhance the power of talents. This is the essence of the Aomoxo Plan.

### Rule Number Four: Start from Series F Funding, or go public directly.


After the 200 Billionare Class Members are all in place, we will immediately maintain efficient consultation and communication with relevant investment institutions around the world through the web, and lobby valuable investors for Aomoxo's financing concept. We will actively cooperate with investment institutions that are truly daring, resolute, and mission-oriented, and work with investors who respect the Aomoxo's "talent-centric" concept, and work together to make Aoxomo a trillion-dollar company.

And at the same time, we will abide to any rules and will continue to make bold innovations and breakthroughs. For example, how about we raise funds directly from the F series, how about we directly enter the IPO process, we will actively try any ideas that allows us to "use as few shares as possible to gain as much capital as possible".
