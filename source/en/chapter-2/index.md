***Except for the 10% of shares used for financing, the remaining 90% of the company's shares will all be used to motivate 37,200 talents., the amount of shares each of them holds guaranteeing that everyone is a billionaire when the market cap hits 1 trillion dollars.***

{% mytitle '20% of Shares' 'To motivate 200 Billionare Class Members, each will be worth 1 billion dollars under one trillion dollar market cap.' %}

{% shares2 '20%' 'Proportion of Shares Owned by All Memebers' '200' 'Member Count' '0.1%' 'Proportion of Shares Owned by Each Member' '1 Billion Dollars' "Each Member's Net Worth at 1 Trillion Dollar Market Cap" %}

We will first take out 20% shares to motivate the top 200 team members who joins Aomoxo before everyone else, each holding 0.1% of shares, so at one trillion dollar market cap, each with shares worth 1 billion dollars, these 200 senior members will all become a true billionaire.

The 200 Billionare Class Members (including ten founders) have the highest shareholding ratio, the highest net worth at the trillion dollar market cap, and also bears the most important responsibilities. They will take the lead in starting and directing Aomoxo's thousands of incredible innovative projects, and together be the guiding force of this world-changing entrepreneurial process.


{% mytitle '20% of Shares' 'To motivate 2000 1/10 Billionare Class Members, each will be worth 100 million dollars under one trillion dollar market cap.' %}

{% shares2 '20%' 'Proportion of Shares Owned by All Memebers' '2000' 'Member Count' '0.01%' 'Proportion of Shares Owned by Each Member' '100 million Dollars' "Each Member's Net Worth at 1 Trillion Dollar Market Cap" %}

Each member holds 0.01% shares, so at 1 trillion market cap, with shares worth 100 million U.S. dollars, Aomoxo's team will also generate 2,000 more billionaires@# worth 100 million.

These are the talents who join Aomoxo after the 200 Billionare Class Members, who are the vanguard of Aomoxo's trillion-dollar market value operation. Hundreds of great, world-changing projects will be produced under their impetus. The 2,000 "billion-dollar-level" team members will be gradually in place according to the actual needs as the projects develop.

{% mytitle '20% of Shares' 'To motivate 10000 1/50 Billionare Class Members, each will be worth 20 million dollars under one trillion dollar market cap.' %}

{% shares2 '20%' 'Proportion of Shares Owned by All Memebers' '10000' 'Member Count' '0.002%' 'Proportion of Shares Owned by Each Member' '20 million Dollars' "Each Member's Net Worth at 1 Trillion Dollar Market Cap" %}

Each member owns 0.002% of shares which, at 1 trillion market cap, are worth 20 million U.S. dollars, more than 120 million yuan, Aomoxo's team will also generate 10,000 more billionaire@# with the net worth of 20 million dollars, more than 120 million yuan.

When the 2,000 1/10 Billionare Class Members are fully in place and capable of take charge of this huge group, the recruitment of the 10,000 1/50 Billionare Class Members team members will be started. Their arrival will make Aomoxo a company of more than ten thousands people, it also means that Aomoxo now has in store the largest number of talents with the highest quality and the strongest motivation for the ambitious goal of achieving a trillion dollar market value.


{% mytitle "5% Founder's Stock" 'To Help Building the Founder Team' %}

{% shares2 '6%' 'Proportion of Shares Owned by all founders' '10' 'Member Count' '1%' 'Proportion of Shares Owned by the Original Founders' '0.5%' 'Proportion of Shares Owned by Other Founders' %}

Ten founders, including two original founders and eight co-founders, all belong to the group of the 200 Billionare Class Memeber. In addition to their 0.1% from being a Billionare Class Member, they also share 5% Founder's Stock: The two original founders each hold 1%, and the other founders each hold 0.5%.

{% mytitle '25% of Shares' 'To motivate 25000 1/100 Billionare Class Members, each will be worth 10 million dollars under one trillion dollar market cap.' %}

{% shares2 '25%' 'Proportion of Shares Owned by All Memebers' '25000' 'Member Count' '0.001%' 'Proportion of Shares Owned by Each Member' '10 million Dollars' "Each Member's Net Worth at 1 Trillion Dollar Market Cap" %}

To ensure that there's enough stock for financing, the remaining 25% could be used for both capital raising and talent incentive, and our policy is financing first (though must be carefully evaluated).

And if the shares used for financing can be successfully controlled within 10%, Aomoxo will add another 25% shares for talent incentive, and be able to recruit 25,000 more 1/100 Billionare Class shareholding talents.

With 0.001% of shares per person, at maximum these 25% of shares can allow us to recruit 25,000 more talents. At 1 trillion dollars market cap, Aomoxo's team will also generate 25,000 more billionaire@# with the net worth of 10 million dollars, more than 60 million yuan.

If that is the case, Aomoxo will truly be able to use all 90% of its shares for talent incentive, and have the means to gather 37,200 "A-Players" for the ambitious goal of achieving one trillion dollar market value!

And at the market capitalization of one trillion dollars, the team of Aomoxo can create not only 12,200 billionaires@#, but also 25,000 billionaires worth 10 million U.S. dollars. What a miracle!
