***Except for the 10% to be used for raising money, the remaining 90% of the company will all be put to use in motivating 37,200 talents, the amount of shares each of them owns guaranteeing that everyone is a "billionaire" when the market cap hits $1 trillion.***

{% shares2 '20%' 'Total Shareholding of All Memebers' '200' 'Member Count' '1/1,000' 'Shareholding of Each Member' '$1 Billion' "Each Member's Net Worth at $1 Trillion Market Cap" %}

We'll first take 20% of the stock to motivate the top 200 team members who joins Aomoxo before everyone else, each owning 1/1,000 of the company's stock. So at $1 trillion market cap, with $1 billion worth of stock per member, these 200 senior members will all be 100% billionaires.

The 200 "Billionaire Class Members" (including ten founders) have the highest shareholdings, and the highest net worths at the trillion dollar market cap, and also bear the most important responsibilities. They will take the lead in starting and directing Aomoxo's thousands of incredible innovative projects, and together be the guiding force of this world-changing entrepreneurial process.


{% mytitle '20% of the stock' 'motivating 2000 "1/10 Billionaire Class Members", each net worth will be up to $100 millions under $1 trillion market cap.' %}

{% shares2 '20%' 'Total Shareholding of All Memebers' '2000' 'Member Count' '1/10,000' 'Shareholding of Each Member' '$100 Millions' "Each Member's Net Worth at $1 Trillion Market Cap" %}

Each member holds 1/10,000 of the stock, so at 1 trillion market cap, with $100 millions worth of stock per member, the Aomoxo team will make 2,000 more "1/10 billionaires".

These are the talents who join Aomoxo right after the 200 "Billionaire Class Members", who are to be the vanguard of Aomoxo's "Trillion Dollar Market Cap Operation". Hundreds of great, world-changing projects will be carried out under their impetus. The 2,000 "1/10 Billionaire Class Members" will be gradually recruited according to the actual needs as the projects develop.

{% mytitle '20% of the stock' 'motivating 10000 "1/50 Billionaire Class Members", each net worth will be up to $20 millions under $1 trillion market cap.' %}

{% shares2 '20%' 'Total Shareholding of All Memebers' '10000' 'Member Count' '1/50000' 'Shareholding of Each Member' '$20 Millions' "Each Member's Net Worth at $1 Trillion Market Cap" %}

Each member owns 1/50000 of the stock which, at $1 trillion market cap, is worth $20 millions, Aomoxo's team will also make 10,000 more "1/50 billionaires".

When the 2,000 "1/10 Billionaire Class Members" are all in place and capable of taking charge of this huge group, the recruitment of the 10,000 "1/50 Billionaire Class Members" will be started immediately. Their arrival will make Aomoxo a company of more than ten thousands people, it also means that Aomoxo now has in store the largest number of talents with the highest quality and the strongest motivation for the ambitious goal of achieving a trillion dollar market cap.

{% shares2 '6%' 'Total Shareholding of All Founders' '10' 'Member Count' '1%' 'Shareholding of Each Original Founder' '0.5%' 'Shareholding of Each Co-Founders' %}

Ten founders, including two original founders and eight co-founders, are also part of the 200 "Billionaire Class Memebers". In addition to their 1/1,000 from being a "Billionaire Class Member", they also share the 5% Founders' Stock: The two original founders each holding 1%, and the other founders each holding 0.5%.

{% mytitle '25% of the stock' 'motivating 25000 "1/100 Billionaire Class Members", each net worth will be up to $10 million under $1 trillion market cap.' %}

{% shares2 '25%' 'Total Shareholding of All Memebers' '25000' 'Member Count' '1/100,000' 'Shareholding of Each Member' '$10 Millions' "Each Member's Net Worth at $1 Trillion Market Cap" %}

To ensure that there's enough stock for financing, the remaining 25% could be used for both capital raising and talent incentive, and our policy is financing first (though must be through careful evalutaions).

And if the shares used for financing can be successfully controlled within 10%, Aomoxo will add another 25% for talent incentive and be able to recruit 25,000 more "1/100 Billionaire Class" shareholding talents.

With 1/100,000 of the stock per member, at maximum these 25% of the stock can allow us to recruit 25,000 more talents. At $1 trillion market cap, the Aomoxo team will make 25,000 more "1/100 billionaires" with the net worth of $10 millions.

If that'd be the case, Aomoxo will truly be able to use all 90% of the company for talent incentive, and have the means to gather 37,200 "A-Players" for the ambitious goal of $1 trillion market cap!

And if calculated by Apple's highest market value of $2.5 trillions, even the members with the lowest shareholding can potentialy have the net worth of $25 millions. What a miracle!

{% mytitle '37200 shareholding talents all fighting together for their "billionaire" dreams' 'will be a creative force never been seen before' %}

This won't be your average, conventional team, and each member won't be your average employee. These people are future stockholders of the company, the real owners of the company, who own stock and have the right to share the profit.

These are real dreamers, with real ambitions. They join Aomoxo, not for mere salaries, but for the dreams of becoming a "billionaire", of making Aomoxo become a trillion dollar company like Apple and Google.

Aomoxo's goal of $1 trillion market cap, is to be realized by the most ambitious dream team ever.

So let us join forces, and work toward a golden future together!
