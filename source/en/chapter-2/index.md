***Except for the 10% to be used for raising money, the remaining 90% of the company will all be put to use in motivating 37,200 talents, the amount of shares each of them holds guaranteeing that everyone is a billionaire@# when the market cap hits $1 trillion.***

{% shares2 '20%' 'Proportion of Shares Owned by All Memebers' '200' 'Member Count' '0.1%' 'Proportion of Shares Owned by Each Member' '$1 Billion' "Each Member's Net Worth at $1 Trillion Market Cap" %}

We will first take out 20% of shares to motivate the top 200 team members who joins Aomoxo before everyone else, each holding 0.1%, so at $1 trillion market cap, each with $1 billion worth of stock, these 200 senior members will all become a true billionaire.

The 200 "Billionare Class Members" (including ten founders) have the highest shareholding ratio, and the highest net worth at the trillion dollar market cap, and also bears the most important responsibilities. They will take the lead in starting and directing Aomoxo's thousands of incredible innovative projects, and together be the guiding force of this world-changing entrepreneurial process.

{% shares2 '20%' 'Proportion of Shares Owned by All Memebers' '2000' 'Member Count' '0.01%' 'Proportion of Shares Owned by Each Member' '$100 Millions' "Each Member's Net Worth at $1 Trillion Market Cap" %}

Each member holds 0.01% shares, so at 1 trillion market cap, with $100 millions worth of stock, the Aomoxo team will make 2,000 more billionaires@#.

These are the talents who join Aomoxo right after the 200 "Billionare Class Members", who are the vanguard of Aomoxo's "Trillion Dollar Market Cap Operation". Hundreds of great, world-changing projects will be produced under their impetus. The 2,000 "1/10 Billionare Class Members" will be gradually in place according to the actual needs as the projects develop.

{% mytitle '20% of shares' 'motivating 10000 "1/50 Billionare Class Members", each net worth will be up to $20 millions under $1 trillion market cap.' %}

{% shares2 '20%' 'Proportion of Shares Owned by All Memebers' '10000' 'Member Count' '0.002%' 'Proportion of Shares Owned by Each Member' '$20 Millions' "Each Member's Net Worth at $1 Trillion Market Cap" %}

Each member owns 0.002% of shares which, at 1 trillion market cap, are worth $20 millions, more than ï¿¥120 millions, Aomoxo's team will also make 10,000 more billionaire@#.

When the 2,000 "1/10 Billionare Class Members" are all in place and capable of taking charge of this huge group, the recruitment of the 10,000 "1/50 Billionare Class Members" will be started immediately. Their arrival will make Aomoxo a company of more than ten thousands people, it also means that Aomoxo now has in store the largest number of talents with the highest quality and the strongest motivation for the ambitious goal of achieving a trillion dollar market value.

Ten founders, including two original founders and eight co-founders, are also part of the 200 "Billionare Class Memebers". In addition to their 0.1% from being a "Billionare Class Member", they also share the 5% Founders' Stock: The two original founders each holding 1%, and the other founders each holding 0.5%.

{% mytitle '25% of shares' 'motivating 25000 "1/100 Billionare Class Members", each net worth will be up to $10 million under $1 trillion market cap.' %}

{% shares2 '25%' 'Proportion of Shares Owned by All Memebers' '25000' 'Member Count' '0.001%' 'Proportion of Shares Owned by Each Member' '$10 Millions' "Each Member's Net Worth at $1 Trillion Market Cap" %}

To ensure that there's enough stock for financing, the remaining 25% could be used for both capital raising and talent incentive, and our policy is financing first (though must be through careful evalutaions).

And if the shares used for financing can be successfully controlled within 10%, Aomoxo will add another 25% of shares for talent incentive, and be able to recruit 25,000 more "1/100 Billionare Class" shareholding talents.

With 0.001% of shares per member, at maximum these 25% of shares can allow us to recruit 25,000 more talents. at $1 trillions market cap, Aomoxo's team will make 25,000 more billionaire@# with the net worth of $10 millions, more than $60 millions.

If that would be the case, Aomoxo will truly be able to use all 90% of its shares for talent incentive, and have the means to gather 37,200 "A-Players" for the ambitious goal of a $1 trillion market value!

And at the market capitalization of $1 trillion, the Aomoxo team can create not only 12,200 billionaires@#, but also 25,000 billionaires with the net worth of $10 millions. What a miracle!

{% mytitle '37200 Shareholding Talents All Fighting Together for Their Billionare@# Dreams' 'Will be a Creative Force Never Been Seen Before' %}

This won't be your average, conventional team, each members won't be your average employee, these people are future stockholders of the company, the real owners of the company, who own stock and are allowed to share the profit.

These are real dreamers, with real ambitions. They join Aomoxo, not for mere salaries, but for the dream of becoming a billionaire@#, of making Aomoxo become a trillion dollar company like Apple and Google.

Aomoxo's goal of $1 trillion market cap, is to be realized by the most ambitious dream team ever.

So let us join forces, and work toward a golden future together!
